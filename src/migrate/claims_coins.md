# Claim PIRL coins from old chain to Pirl 2.0

This tutorial describes how to claim your Pirl from “old chain” to Pirl 2.0.<br>
Balance of Pirls where taken from snapshot at block 7 650 000, meaning you will only be able to claim what you had in balance at this block.

In this tutorial we will use the MEW wallet and Pirl 2.0 Portal.<br>
Before proceeding, you will have to create a wallet in the Pirl 2.0 Portal and log in to your Pirl wallet in [MEW](https://www.myetherwallet.com/access-my-wallet) using your Keystore file.

If you dont get any Pirl balance in the MEW wallet, please check your Network settings (1) and set to (PIRL) as shown in picture below.<br>
- <strong>Note:</strong> It has been tested and verified that the claim works fine without changing the network as well.

## [Pirl 2.0 Portal https://dashboard.pirl.network](https://dashboard.pirl.network)
