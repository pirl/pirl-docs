## Introduction

Having all documentation conform to the same standards makes for easier use of the documentation over time.  The best time to decide on conventions is before writing is done. If you stumble on something that's not addressed here, make sure you bring it up to the community so a decision can be made on how best to address it.

## General Guidelines

* Try to use as few words as possible while remaining descriptive.
* Assume the audience doesn't know all the background you do. Be specific and don't omit important information.
* For actions, put key words in bold (ex: Open Chrome, select the **address** field at the top and fill in **www.pirl.io**)

## Grammar

* Use Oxford commas
* American English spelling is used for variant words.

## Table of Contents

* A TOC is recommended for documents longer than 2 computer screen lengths.

## Titles and Headings

* The title of the page is within the **title:** field of the document. Don't include the title again in the start of the document.
* Each document starts with an **Introduction** or a **Description** section which explains the background behind the document.
* Headings start at the ## level.
* Use headings starting with ### to further separate smaller sections within bigger ones for ease of viewing.
* Each document contains a **Summary** or **TL;DR** section which summarizes the steps for advanced users.

## Links

* If referencing the wiki itself, always include the link for ease of use
* Use good descriptions for you links in general
* When in doubt, link it

## Credits

* At the end of each document, the name of the author is included as well as the author last update
