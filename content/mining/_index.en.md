## Mining



Mining is the process of adding transaction records to PIRL public ledger of past transactions ( a „mining rig“ is a collo- quial metaphor for a single computer system that performs the necessary computations for „mining“).
This ledger of past transactions is called the “block-chain” as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place.
PIRL nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate PIRL transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent el- sewhere.
Mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by mi- ners remains steady.
Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other PIRL nodes each time they receive a block.
PIRL uses the ethash proof-of-work algorithm.
The primary purpose of mining is to set the history of transac- tions in a way that is computationally impractical to modify by any one entity.
By downloading and verifying the blockchain, PIRL nodes are able to reach consensus about the ordering of events in PIRL.
Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce PIRL coins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a „subsidy“ of newly created coins.
This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized man- ner, as well as, motivating people to provide security for the system.
PIRL mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion (proof of work POW) and it slowly makes new units available to anybody who wi- shes to take part.


## EZminer


PIRL has a goal to be as user-friendly as possible while provi- ding a state of the art platform for developers.
All aspects of the network are carefully analyzed and under development to reach a simple use for everyone without requiring advan- ced technical knowledge to operate.
For example, in regards to mining, we created the EZminer, so anyone who owns a GPU is able to mine in 3 easy steps that do not require any advanced technical knowledge.
PIRL EZminer is a simple ap- plication that guides you through 3 easy steps to mine PIRL with your AMD or Nvidia GPU. The application takes care of all the necessary modules that need to be installed in the background and setups the miner.

The user simply needs to pick his pool and the address to mine to.

EZminer Features:

• Easy setup of eZminer.

• Windows 64bit / Linux / Mac Os X.

• Direct Link to wallet creation.

• PIRL Wallet recognition in the system Oystr/Nautilus.

• Pool list.

• Manual override of wallet address in case of wallet detec- tion.

• Advanced settings including Intensity and miner output with dashboard in e-miners case.

• On applications UI links for everything related to PIRL and the project.

• Direct linking via the UI to pool site for monitoring the user mining status.
